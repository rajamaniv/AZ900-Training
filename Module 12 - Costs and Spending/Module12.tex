\end{center}
\section{Purchasing Azure products and services}

At the end of each monthly billing cycbe, the usage values will be charges to your payment method and the meters are reset.\\
\\
You can deallocate a VM so that it is not assigned to a CPU or network in a datacenter, but the physical disks maintain so that it is easy to resume it.
\section{Factors affecting cost}
\subsection{Resource Type}
Costs are resource specific, so different resources cost different amounts
\subsection{Services}
Azure usage rates differ between Enterprise, Web Direct and CSP customers
\subsection{Location}
Cost depends on what datacenter is running the service due to efficiency and cost of local resources
\subsection{Azure Billing Zones}
Data transfer pricing depends on what zones are being used
\section{Saving on infrastructure costs}
\subsection{Azure Credits}
Visual Studio subscribers get a monthly credit benefit for testing
\subsection{Use spending limits}
You can set a limit so that you aren't charged once you have used up your credits. This is specific to subscriptions that include a monthly Azure credit allotment
\subsection{Reserved instances}
If you know you have static and predictable costs you can reserve for one or three year to save money
\subsection{Low cost locations and regions}
Some regions are cheaper, ensure all resources are in that region or you will have a cost of sending data between regions
\subsection{Reduce the size of Virtual machines}
Oversized virtual machines will cost money for performance that isn't being used
\subsection{Deallocate virtual machines in off hours}
You can use the auto shutdown feature to either reduce capacity by reducing the number of virtual machines behind a load balancer or stop a service
\subsection{Migrate to PaaS or SaaS}
The higher up you go, the cheaper the cost
\section{Save on licensing cost}
In Linux you don't have to pay a licence cost.
\subsection{Azure Hybrid Benefit}
If you already have a Windows Server Licence covered by software assurance you can get a large discount by using this licence in Azure.
\subsubsection{Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server}
Similarly, SQL licences can be given for a saving.
\subsection{Use Dev/Test subscription offers}
By specifying you are in a non production environment, you don't need to pay a licence fee
\subsection{Bring your own SQL server license}
If you are on an Enterprise agreement and have an investment in SQL server licences, you can use this in Virtual machines for free. 
\subsection{Use SQL server developer edition}
SQL server developer edition is a free product for nonproduction use
\subsection{Use constrained instance sizes of database workloads}
SQL server costs are per core, so my reducing the number of cores, you can save on cost
