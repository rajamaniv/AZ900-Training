# Module 1 - Cloud Concepts

- High availability - shared responsibility
- Scalability - Add more resources
  - Scaling up - Making a component bigger or faster
  - Scaling out - Adding more components
- Elasticity - Dynamic scalability, increase scale if something causes increased traffic
- Agility - Speed to set up
- Fault tolerance - Microsoft responsibility, how errors are handled
- Disaster recovery - Backup, recovery environment with VM
- Global reach - Data centres across the globe
- Customer latency - High speed network
- Predictive cost considerations - Provide good estimated of how much it will cost
- Security - Shared responsibility,
- Economies of scale
  - Less expensive
  - More efficient
  - Pass benefits on

## CapEx vs OpEx

CapEx (Capital expenditure)

- Spend on physical infrastructure

OpEx

- Monthly bill
- Pay as you go
- Get set up immediately
- No upfront costs

Azure follows a consumption based model, which just has operational expenditure

## Types of cloud models

Public cloud

- Resources accessed over secure connection
- No CapEx, just OpEx

Private cloud

- On premises
- Full responsibility for management
- Full control

Hybrid cloud

- Connecting the public and private cloud
- Run things where they are most appropriate
- Compliance - Private info etc
- Most flexible

## Types of cloud services

### IaaS

Not responsible for:

- Datacenter
- Networking firealls
- Servers+Storage

Most flexible
Configure and manage hardware

### PasS

Not responsible for:

- IaaS + OS

Focus on application development

### SaaS

Only responsible for data+access

Access in Azure via marketplace

Pay as you go pricing

Users pay for software they use on a subscription model

### Comparison

- Moving up the stack reduces costs as managing less
