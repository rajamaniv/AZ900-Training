# Module 1 - Cloud Concepts

## What is cloud computing

Services typically offered

- Compute power
- Storage
- Networking
- Analytics

Containers - Provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for applications.

- Standard runtime environment used to execute the app
- Leading platform is docker

Serverless computing - Run application code without creating, configuring or maintaining a server

- Application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some action
- Only pay for the processing time used by each function as it executes

## Benefits of cloud computing

Cost effective

- No upfront infrastructure costs
- Not buying infrastructure that isn't fully utilised
- Can scale up and down with demand

Scalability

- Vertical scaling (scaling up)
  - Adding more resources to a server
- Horizontal scaling (scaling out)

  - Adding more servers

Elasticity

- Automatically adding more resources to handle traffic

Current

- Don't have to think about having current hardware and patches

Reliability (Microsoft responsibility)

- Provided backup, recovery replication etc
- Fault tolerance

Global

- Fully redundant datacenters
- High availability (shared responsibility)

Security (shared responsibility)

- Both physical and digital

## Compliance terms and requirements

Questions include

- How compliant is the cloud provider when it comes to handling sensitive data
- How compliant are the services offered by the cloud provider
- How can I deploy my own cloud-based solutions to scenarios that have accreditation or compliance requirements?
- What terms are part of the privacy statement for the provider?

## Economies of scale

- Less expensive
- More efficient
- Pass benefits on

* Agility - Speed to set up
* Customer latency - High speed network
* Predictive cost considerations - Provide good estimated of how much it will cost
* Economies of scale

## CapEx vs OpEx

CapEx (Capital expenditure)

- Spend on physical infrastructure
- Storage
- Network
- Backup and archive
- Organisation continuity and disaster recovery
- Datacentre infrastructure
- Technical personnel

OpEx

- Monthly bill
- Pay as you go
- Get set up immediately
- No upfront costs
- Leasing software and customised features
- Scaling charges based on usage/demand
- Billing at the user or organisation level

Azure follows a consumption based model, which just has operational expenditure

## Types of cloud models

Public cloud

- Resources accessed over secure connection
- No CapEx, just OpEx

Private cloud

- On premises
- Full responsibility for management
- Full control

Hybrid cloud

- Connecting the public and private cloud
- Run things where they are most appropriate
- Compliance - Private info etc
- Most flexible

## Types of cloud services

### IaaS

Not responsible for:

- Datacenter
- Networking firealls
- Servers+Storage

Most flexible
Configure and manage hardware

### PaaS

Not responsible for:

- IaaS + OS

Focus on application development

### SaaS

Only responsible for data+access

Access in Azure via marketplace

Pay as you go pricing

Users pay for software they use on a subscription model

### Comparison

- Moving up the stack reduces costs as managing less
