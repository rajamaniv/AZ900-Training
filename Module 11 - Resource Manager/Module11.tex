\section{Principles of resource groups}
\begin{definition}[Resource groups]
	A logical container for resources deployed on Azure
\end{definition}
All resources must be in a resource group and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group.\\
\\
If you delete a resource group, all resources container within are also deleted.\\
\\
Resource groups are a scope for applying RBAC to limit access to allow only what is needed
\section{Using tagging to organise resources}
\begin{definition}[Tags]
	Name/value pairs of text data that you can apply to resources and resource groups
\end{definition}
A resource can have up to 50 tags\\
\\
Tags can be used to group billing data or to keep track of usage for different projects\\
\\
Not all resources support tags, so you need to check your resource supports them
\section{Resource locks}
\begin{definition}[Resource Locks]
	A setting that can be applied to any resource to block modification or deletion
\end{definition}
Resource locks can be either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Delete - Allow all operations against the resource but block the ability to delete it
	\item Read-only - Only allow read activities to be performed against it, blocking any modification or deletion of the resource
\end{itemize}
